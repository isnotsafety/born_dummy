# born_dummy

born_dummy is a simple Node.js project for creating a basic calculator. As I begin my journey on GitHub, this project serves as an introduction to version control and Node.js development. It aims to provide a foundation for learning more about GitHub and Node.js, marking my initial steps in the vast world of software development.

## Purpose

The purpose of born_dummy is twofold:

1. **Learning**: born_dummy provides a hands-on opportunity to understand the basics of GitHub, version control, and project management. It also serves as a playground to experiment with Node.js programming concepts.

2. **Aspiration**: While born_dummy may be a small project, it symbolizes the initial step towards larger ambitions. By starting here, we pave the way for future projects, including the realization of our dream to develop significant software solutions.
